            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <div>
                <p>My name is Garrett Britton and I'm currently a licensed claims adjuster. I am in school for a 24 
                    week long full stack coding bootcamp. I've been coding in HTML, Python, and Java on and off 
                    since my senior year in highschool. I've learned a lot online and in the few classes I've taken 
                    throughout highschool and college but I wan't to expand my horizons and challenge myself to finish a full 
                    structered course. When I'm not in school or at work I'm hanging out with friends, working out 
                    at the gym, or riding my motorcycle if the weather permits.</p>
